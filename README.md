## Notes About The Assignment

### General

- for this assignment purposes categories are hardcoded in components, but in real life some dynamic solution would be implemented

### What else could have been done

- loading component
- rendering error messages
- error boundary component
- more robust tests
- modal could be updated to close on an outside click and outside scrolling could be disabled
- render date in some useful format
